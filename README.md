## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to create an interactive webpage to view results from a selected participant's belly button swab. Each ID number represents a participant from the student. The webpage will display the following information about the selected participant (ID):
- Demographic information
- The top ten OTU IDs
- The belly button washing frequency (per week)
- A bubble chart displaying the OTU IDs present and their respective counts
